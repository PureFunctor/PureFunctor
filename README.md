# Greetings ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught programmer who's currently learning Functional Programming through Haskell.

- I'm continuously learning and using :snake: Python and :blue_book: Haskell for my hobby projects.
- I'm also fond of learning/talking about programming language features, implementations, and theoretical concepts in general.
- Iâ€™m looking into learning and creating software in low-level languages such as :gear: C/C++ and :crab: Rust in the near future.
- I'm part of the staff on the [Python Discord](https://git.pydis.com), a large community focused around the Python programming language, helping new and experienced developers alike.

Feel free to check out my pinned projects below.
